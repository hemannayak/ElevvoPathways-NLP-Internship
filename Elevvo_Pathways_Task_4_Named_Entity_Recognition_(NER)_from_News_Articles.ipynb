        "\n",
        "## Objective:\n",
        "This task focuses on performing Named Entity Recognition (NER) using both rule-based and model-based approaches on the **CoNLL-2003 dataset**. The aim is to identify and categorize entities like **PERSON**, **ORGANIZATION**, and **GPE (Geopolitical Entity)** in news text.\n",
        "\n",
        "The project also includes a comparison of two SpaCy models – `en_core_web_sm` and `en_core_web_lg`, and the implementation of a **BiLSTM model** for enhanced entity recognition. Additionally, visualization is done using **SpaCy's displaCy**.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🗂 Dataset:\n",
        "- **CoNLL-2003 Named Entity Recognition Dataset**\n",
        "- Source: Kaggle\n",
        "- Format: Token-level tagging with BIO (Begin-Inside-Outside) format\n",
        "- Entities considered: `PERSON`, `ORG`, `GPE`\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🛠 Tools and Libraries Used:\n",
        "- **Python**\n",
        "- **SpaCy** – for rule-based and pre-trained model-based NER\n",
        "- **Pandas & NumPy** – for data handling\n",
        "- **TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch** – for BiLSTM implementation\n",
        "- **Matplotlib & displaCy** – for visualization\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## ✅ Key Steps:\n",
        "1. **Load and Preprocess the Dataset**\n",
        "   - Parse and clean the CoNLL-2003 format\n",
        "   - Structure the data for both rule-based and BiLSTM models\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Rule-Based NER (SpaCy)**\n",
        "   - Apply simple rules to extract named entities using SpaCy’s built-in pipeline\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Model-Based NER with SpaCy**\n",
        "   - Load two pre-trained models: `en_core_web_sm` and `en_core_web_lg`\n",
        "   - Extract and compare named entities across models\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Custom BiLSTM-Based NER**\n",
        "   - Tokenize and pad sequences\n",
        "   - Train a BiLSTM model for sequence labeling\n",
        "   - Evaluate using precision, recall, and F1-score\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Visualization and Comparison**\n",
        "   - Use displaCy to visually highlight extracted entities\n",
        "   - Compare performance between models (SpaCy vs BiLSTM)\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🧾 Outcome:\n",
        "By the end of this task, we will have:\n",
        "- A working pipeline for named entity recognition\n",
        "- Comparison of multiple models on NER\n",
        "- Visual insights into how models detect entities in text\n",
